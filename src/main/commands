Commands from clients to the server:

CONNECT#<user>  --> Connects the user to the server. The server then validates the user and sends ONLINE command to user.
If <user> is not found --> server will close connection and throw CLOSE#2 //not sure it 'throws'

SEND#<user>#text.. --> who do you want to send the message to? What will you send?
SEND#<user1>,<user2>#text.. --> For multiply users use "," to indicate multiple users
SEND#*#text.. --> Use "*" to send text to all users

CLOSE# --> discard all messages received. Server throws CLOSE#0 (for a normal close) and closes the clients connection.


Commands from Server to client(s):

Whenever a client connect/disconnect a list of all members online will be sent to
all clients currently online --> ONLINE#<User1>,<User2>,<User3>

Everytime a client sends a message the server adds MESSAGE --> MESSAGE#<User>#text...

0 for a normal close --> CLOSE#0
1 illegal input was received --> CLOSE#1
2 User not found --> CLOSE#2
When a close command is sent the server should close the connection and release all resources attached to that client.

Things to consider:

You can send messages to people that are not online --> check if user is online when send message?
You can connect to another user when already logged in
If user logs off by closing the window, the other users will not be notified
User will not be notified if they type an unknown command
There are no log-file to hold information
